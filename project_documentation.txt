APPOINTIV - Doctor Appointment Management System
==========================================

ABSTRACT
--------
Appointiv is a comprehensive web-based healthcare appointment management system designed to streamline the process of scheduling and managing medical appointments. The platform connects patients with healthcare providers through an intuitive interface, offering real-time appointment booking, management, and administrative controls. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), the system provides separate interfaces for patients, doctors, and administrators, ensuring efficient healthcare service delivery.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
---------------
1. Traditional medical appointment systems often involve lengthy phone calls and manual scheduling

4. No centralized system for managing multiple healthcare providers
5. Poor communication channels between patients, doctors, and administrative staff
6. Manual handling of appointment cancellations and rescheduling
7. Difficulty in managing patient load and doctor availability
8. Limited access to healthcare provider information and specialties
